# Code repository for the paper "Archaeological Sites Detection with a Human-AI Collaboration Workflow"

This repository contains the code described in the paper "Archaeological Sites Detection with a Human-AI Collaboration Workflow" submitted to PNAS by
L.Casini, V.Orr√π, A.Montanucci, N.Marchetti and M.Roccetti.
The code contained here is the result of work by Casini and Montanucci.

The Python script `stampa_imm_qgis` is a script to be used inside QGIS. It contains function to save the input images and target masks for the segmentation models.
The iPython notebook contains all the code needed to train and evaluate models.
Running those experiments should reflect the results we obtained and described in the paper.

Upon request we can provide the weights for the trained model we used (their size is too large for GitHub).
If you are interested or need support with code an email to `luca.casini7@unibo.it`
